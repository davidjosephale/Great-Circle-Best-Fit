## Purpose: 
# Take any data set containing latitude and longitude coordinates of any number
# of data points, and the program will plot them on a sphere representing the 
# earth according to a spherical least squares best fit â€“ essentially
# minimizing the distance between a plane and all the points (linear distance)
